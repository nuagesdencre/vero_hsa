## DCU Writing Centre experience

I presented the abstract along with the Discussion section of the dissertation.

Paula (an amazing adviser) broke down the way to distribute the word count within the section. She also gave me insight how to better link the findings, ensure it was clear that they came from the research data, AND link those with the literature previously explored.

*Takeaways*
- Include more references and express findings in tandem
- Balance the paragraphs
- Be more direct in the way that I make associations and draw correlations/conclusions
