    - has to be an orinal contribution (if possible)
    - be researchable, answerable, measurable empirically
    - be interesting and relevant to someone other than myself

## Ideas

-Collectors
- perspectives on virtual collections
- user ex perience, emotional connection, relationship with purchases

- Do the new interfaces of streaming music services allow people to connect with their digital item as much as they do with a physical object

- music or books
- epubs?
