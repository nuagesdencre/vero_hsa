## Data Classification

In plain English

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/types-of-data-in-statistics-nominal-ordinal-interval-and-ratio-data-types-explained-with-examples/

> Nominal data
> Nominal data are used to label variables without any quantitative value. Common examples include male/female (albeit somewhat outdated), hair color, nationalities, names of people, and so on. 

> Ordinal data
> The key with ordinal data is to remember that ordinal sounds like order - and it's the order of the variables which matters. Not so much the differences between those values.
> Ordinal scales are often used for measures of satisfaction, happiness, and so on.

## Measurement methods

I want to collect data to compare usage (frequency and context), persistence (listening patterns or preference over time, discovery and sharing habits), curation (organisational structure/playlists and personal signification).

  > Enjoyment The notion of enjoyment is a seemingly commonplaceone, yet it is not easy to arrive at a precise and gener-ally  agreed  upon  meaning.  Enjoyment  is  sometimestreated  as  a  synonym  for  happiness,  pleasure,  flow,usefulness,  or  ease  of  use.

  "The new instrument measures enjoyment of any activity, called the ENJOY scale. The ENJOY scale has 5 subscales and demonstrated good content validity, internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. The ENJOY scale was developed based on the evaluation of over 600 unique activities including entertainment- and work-based activities. Therefore, the scale can be applied to evaluating enjoyment across activities. The 25-item version of the ENJOY scale proved to have the best model fit and was composed of the factors of pleasure, relatedness, competence, challenge/improvement, and engagement."

  > The ENJOY scale is an innovative way to measure enjoyment in several ways. First, the
  ENJOY scale can be administered and used to evaluate enjoyment across any activity.
  Additionally, the ENJOY scale was developed with simple language that can be easily understood
  by anyone with at least some high school education. The ENJOY scale was developed and
  validated based on the assessment of over 600 unique activities across a wide range of categories.

  Last, the final version of the ENJOY scale is not lengthy, consisting of only 25 items across the 5
  subscales. The entire scale takes between 3-5 minutes to complete.
