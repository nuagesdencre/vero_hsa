  >In setting the context, for many people in society, in particular demographers, academe, and journalists, the Millennials have grown up in a society with a great sense of freedom, in comparison to their predecessors—the Baby Boomers.

  >Moreover, Facebook and other social media platforms facilitate Millennials to play out their life across the respective social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter), while communicating and socializing with friends, peers, and strangers, thus resulting in many Millennials showing a positive approach to taking up the varying developments [7] of ICTs and social media platforms.

Following this understanding, playlists become address books and streaming collections become information collections, while sustaining its status as a music collection in a phenomenological sense.
