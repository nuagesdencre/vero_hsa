## Survey responses

- Over 70 complete responses at this point; I will be discarding the partial responses

- Cleaning up the data file to create visualisation with PowerBI

- Quite a few good comments left regarding physical music collections and streaming services.

- No one has mentioned only having physical music records; according to the answers, most people have a combination of both types of collection.


### Advantages and disadvantages of survey research (https://academic.oup.com/intqhc/article/15/3/261/1856193)

### Advantages:

    - The research produces data based on real-world observations (empirical data).

    - The breadth of coverage of many people or events means that it is more likely than some other approaches to obtain data based on a representative sample, and can therefore be generalizable to a population.

    - Surveys can produce a large amount of data in a short time for a fairly low cost. Researchers can therefore set a finite time-span for a project, which can assist in planning and delivering end results.

### Disadvantages:

    - The significance of the data can become neglected if the researcher focuses too much on the range of coverage to the exclusion of an adequate account of the implications of those data for relevant issues, problems, or theories.

    - The data that are produced are likely to lack details or depth on the topic being investigated.

    - Securing a high response rate to a survey can be hard to control, particularly when it is carried out by post, but is also difficult when the survey is carried out face-to-face or over the telephone.
