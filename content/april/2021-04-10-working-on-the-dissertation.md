## Dissertation is coming along! 

The finishing line is in sight!

I have made multiple changes to my draft following the input of my supervisor and I have managed to secure an appointment with the writing centre later on this week.

At this point, I am starting to put together the final assignment and it is extremely encouraging to see it take form. While I feel I still have a lot to do, looking back at the work accomplished in the last month and putting together the notes for the journal shows there's been a steady effort.

I will be revising the abstract and the methodology over the weekend. The next step will be to prepare the appendices and ensure I respect the overall word count.
