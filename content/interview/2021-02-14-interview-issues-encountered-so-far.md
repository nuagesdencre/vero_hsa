Technical issues

- Using Otter.ai (free version) with the phone while relying on the phone to pick up audi seems to clash
- Otter.ai can create transcripts from imported audio
- Zoom time limit for meeting is 40 minutes; had to buy Zoom Pro to drop limit and allow the conversation to flow naturally instead of being conscious of time
- French accent and other accents picked up differently by Otter.ai

Interview flow issues

- Participants asking for examples as they want to provide the 'right answer'
