## Key points

### Changes necessary for ethics approval

- What data you are collecting
- How collecting, analysing, storing and deleting 
- Detail out the spotify data  

Ethics: Additional information

*What data you are collecting*

Gender (from the survey)
Email (from the survey)
Age range (from the survey)
Location (from the survey)
Music streaming history 
Playlists (from Spotify playlist history json file)

*How collecting, analysing, storing and deleting* 

The survey will be made and distributed using an online tool (Qualtrics, Survey Monkey).

The data gathered from the survey and the interview will be analysed thematically. The Spotify data will be used to support the themes identified.

The data will be collected and stored in my DCU account Google drive.The data will be deleted at the end of the academic year.

*Justification for low risk*

There will be no data collected outside of the listed items; this data will be kept secure in the Google Drive assigned to my DCU account. The data will be deleted at the end of the academic year. The data will be anonymised and I will make use of pseudonyms when appropriate (i.e. quoting an interview statement).

The subject of the research study does not target sensitive content or input from the participants. However, should there be any unease or discomfort, the participants can withdraw, refuse to answer the question and opt out at any point in the survey and interview process. Links to support resources will be provided at the end of the survey and the interview.


*Vulnerability*

The subject of the research study does not target sensitive content or input from the participants. However, should there be any unease or discomfort, the participants can withdraw, refuse to answer the question and opt out at any point in the survey and interview process. Links to support resources will be provided at the end of the survey and the interview.


*Justification for sample size*

Based on the reported Irish user base for Spotify, I used the sample size calculator to estimate the correct sample size to reach a confidence level of over 90%. I rounded up the figure provided to 400. I have since been advised that a level of confidence over 80% would be perfectly acceptable, hence I revise my sample pool for the survey to 208 for an estimated level of confidence of 85%.The sample size for interview remains the same as it is an acceptable sample size in the context of qualitative interview and is reflective of the time and resources available for this project.

“Spotify has more than 600,000 paid subscribers in Ireland, while upwards of 1.3 million people are thought to have used its free, ad-funded service at some point.”


*Detail out the spotify data*  

First of all, this step will remain entirely optional and detailed steps will be provided to the participants. The data will be sent to my DCU email account and stored on the DCU account Google Drive for the duration of the academic year.  If participants send any other data than the one specified, this data will be deleted immediately.


*Steps to retrieve the data*
Full details and screenshots [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aLpHAALhcPWFr6b0ZyVDev5kR8_bn-v3TNzKmSiaZvY/edit#heading=h.osad709wrksf)

1. Access the account page of Spotify using a computer, not the mobile application.

On the browser version of Spotify, the option is available via a dropdown.

2. In the account options, select Privacy Settings.

3. In the privacy setting, there will be an option to download your data. Click on the black request button in the first square indicating ‘step 1’ to start the process.

4. Spotify will send an email will a link once the data is available. This can take hours or days, it will not be immediate.

5. Once you click on the link, you will be brought back to the account page where you can download a ZIP file containing your data. This ZIP file can be decompressed using WinRAR or 7zip. If you need more technical support, please contact me at veronique.savard2@mail.dcu.ie.

The files extracted outside of the ZIP file look like this:

6. In the context of this research, I only ask to analyse the streaming history and playlists files. There could be one or more files identified by the name StreamingHistory and Playlist followed by a number. I ask you to attach these StreamingHistory and Playlist files to an email addressed to veronique2.savard@mail.dcu.ie.

Please do not send any other files, anything other than these files will be deleted upon reception.

7. The StreamingHistory and Playlist files will be stored on the DCU account Google Drive for the duration of the academic year. The data contained in those files will be anonymised and a pseudonym will be used if there is any reference to it. Participants can decide to withdraw their data from the research study at any point in time.

8. The data contained in the two files is not personal information.

The StreamingHistory files is one json file pertinent to tracks and dates on which said tracks were listened to. The fields are endTime (date the track was listened to), artistName, trackName and msPlayed (duration of the song in milliseconds).


  The Playlist file contains is a json file with an array of playlists and the tracks that they are made of, the date on which the playlist was last modified, along with the number of followers and a description field. The localTrack field indicates if the music is stored locally instead of the Spotify library.



9. I will use a visualisation tool to analyse the data (Power BI) and support the findings made using other data gathering methods (survey, interview, literature).
I plan to draw observations on the usage of Spotify over the past months, the number of playlists recorded and the latest updated playlists, along with the oldest playlist in terms of modification date.

## Next steps
- Improving questions

Revising interview questions and instead of implementing the ENJOY scale, derive inspiration from it in terms of measuring enjoyment while listening to music
