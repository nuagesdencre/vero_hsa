>Due  to increasing  affordability  of  multimedia-enabled  phones  and voice/data plans and wider penetration of mobile coverage, the  mobile  phone  has  quickly  become the  most  prevalent digital    music    device    in    the    infrastructure-challenged resource-constrained  communities  we  study  [13].

>With  the  digital  representation  of  mobile  media,  however, the giver does not lose while the taker still gains. As long as a  single  party  is  aware  of  the  mechanism  of  conducting  a transfer,  songs  can  be  transferred  seamlessly  and  without  a financial  cost.  The  material  nature  of  the  music  file  makes its presence felt when the size of the file is large enough to take   more   than   a   few   seconds   to   transfer,   but   with songs/song videos, this is almost never the case.

>New  soundtracks  are  released  at  a  pace  that  makes  it  hard for listeners to keep track of the singers or the album. This was  reflected  also  in  the  obscure  filenames  that  we  found, while conducting a survey of mobile phone data to see what kind  of  mobile  media  was  being  consumed,  e.g.  “j.mp3”, “djmazaa.mp3”, etc. “With  so  many  new  songs  available every  week,  “  Maheshji  said,  “only  a  few  songs  become popular...others flow away like rainwater.”

>According  to  him,  they  only  listened  to  the music  (going  from  “next  song  to  next  song  to  next”)  and did   not   care   to   identify   the   singer   or   album.   Music, according to Rajan, is a “thing to use and forget, not a work of art anymore.” This lessened appreciation for music in the mobile   age came   across   to   us as   one   of   the   notable consequences of its material form. 

>...technologies   have   influenced practices of music consumption

>Our  respondents  had  a  strong  association  between  piracy and   “poor   quality”   (whereas   pirated   digital   media is commonly  of  high-quality  as  well).  This  association may have stemmed  from  the  fact  that  “cheaper”  is  typically associated with “poor quality” and pirated music is cheaper.

>Original  versions were  always  more  expensive,  but they often also occupy more storage space

>For instance, digital reproduction enables the deliberate loss of  information  (by  downsampling)  in  ways  that  analog media   did   not,   and   this   affordance   allows   our   study participants to support their social and aesthetic preferences as  they  pick  quantity  over  quality,  a  tradeoff  that  was previously  inaccessible  to  them.
