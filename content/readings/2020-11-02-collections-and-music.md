## Building the research study
### Sifting through documentation, articles

- Vlachos, P., & Vrechopoulos, A. (2004). _Emerging Customer Trends Towards Mobile Music Services_. www.mad.gr (Accessed 2 November 2020)

  >Currently,  there  are  several  ventures  (e.g.  musiwave,  listen.com,  etc) that try to exploit the inherent characteristics and benefits that the   mobile   networks   and   devices   offer   for   delivering   music   content     on-demand.  

  >While  the  demand  for  music  products  and  services  seems  to  be  quite strong, on the other hand there is a slump (both in revenues and  units)  in  the  sales  of  the  traditional  vehicle  for  experiencing  music  -  that  is  music  CDs.

  >In  our  research  setting  we  define  mobile  music  as  the  provision  of  an  on  demand  personalized  streaming  music  service  over  mobile  devices  that  include music audio, music video clips and music related content (music news, artists’ biographies e.t.c.).

  >As   “music   consumers”   we   define   people   that   acquire,   use/   experience and dispose music in any format (CDs, mp3s, records, cassettes  etc)  and  on  any  medium  (Radio,  TV,  hi-fi,  live  music  events etc) [24].   
  
  >However,  online  surveys  are considered to be a sampling technique suitable for exploratory research  designs  like  the  present  one  and  quite  ordinary  in  e-commerce research arena

  > Use  methods  that  are  appropriate  to  your  approach  and  analysis  strategy  to  determine  sample  size.  For  example,  if  you  plan  to  perform  statistical  analyses,  use  a  power  analysis; for qualitative work use saturation.

  >Note  any  constraints  with  respect  to  sample  size.  If  cost  or  feasibility  concerns  played  a  part  in  sample  size  determination,  note  these  [8;  17].  Explain  how  these  limitations affect the interpretation of your findings. 

  > Finally, caution is required when using local standards. For example,  using  solely  local  standards  in  quantitative  work  is considered ineffective by statisticians [14; 15].

  > At  the  beginning,  when  a  researcher  is  choosing  the  size  s/he  wants  their  sample  to  be,  determining  how  many participants to include is an important, yet sometimes tricky  process.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  research  process  when  a  reviewer  is  evaluating  the  validity  of  claims  made  based  on  data  presented,  the  reviewer  must  evaluate  the  sample  size  presented  against  conclusions  drawn.

  > Apart  from  utilitarian functions these objects also play a role in shaping and  communicating  our  identities  and  social  relationships,  which  has  been  illustrated  by  material  culture  studies  [e.g.  4,  15,  25]. 

  >Capturing, storing and using digital objects can thus be seen as an extension of collecting and using physical objects.

  > Studies  in  social  sciences  and  HCI  have  given  insights  in  what  objects  we  cherish  and  why  [2,  11,  12,  17,  18,  20,  21]  and  the  more  recent  ones  have  started  to  compare  cherishing  of  physical  and  digital  objects  [11,  12,  20]. 
  
  > Gonzáles  further  introduces  the  notion  of  ‘autotopography’  to  indicate  that  the   arrangement   of   physical   objects   with   which   we   surround  ourselves,  such  as  clothing  or  furniture,  has  an  autobiographical   function,   and   says   something   about   ourselves,    our    memories,    histories    and    beliefs    [9].

  > Further,  this  study  contributes  to  previous  work by exploring further advantages and disadvantages of physical  and  digital,  and  by  reflecting  on  if  physicality  or  ‘digitality’ influences how special an object is perceived to be.

  > Compared  to  individual  interviews,  focus  groups  add  elements  of  interactivity  between  participants  that  can  benefit  sharing  experiences  in  the  sessions,  which  was  deemed  important  for  this  study  of  cherished  objects  and  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  physical  and  digital.

  > More  cherishable  digital  objects  can  support  meaningful  use of digital objects, e.g. for reminiscence and storytelling, and   can   encourage   engagement   in   active   selection   of   meaningful media to keep and use, which is why we believe it  is  important  for  designers  and  developers  to  consider  these issues in future design of products and systems.

  > In this article we seek to excavate the home archive, exploring those things that people chooseto keep rather than simply accumulate. 

  >  In support of this we show how sentimentalartifacts are also used to connect with others, to define the self and the family, to fulfill obligations and, quite conversely to efforts of remembering, to safely forget.

  > Additionally, as physical objects age they degrade, butthis fragility is often cherished, and the development of patina through useor neglect can add value to an object. Such affordances of the physical arenot normally applied to our digital artefacts (after all—digital is supposed tobe forever) but evidently such aspects of physicality might lead to intriguingredesigns of digital objects giving them new values.

  > Making such an explicit connection between objects and their associations might be either disturbing or compelling.

  > Another aspect of considering the important aspects of physicality is to con-sider how digital objects might take on some of the affordances of the physical world.

  > This suggests that exploring waysof enabling new kinds of serendipitous display for digital objects, otherwiseburied deep in collections, would be compelling [Petrelli et al. 2009]. 

  > More than just flickingthrough a repository of “memories,” we interact with our home archives in dis-tinct ways, showing different types of reminiscence and different motivations for archiving at all.

  > User interviews and survey data show thatusers’ behaviors change according to their goals, such as listeningto recommended tracks in the moment, or using recommendationsas a starting point for exploration. 

  > Designing music information access systems requires understand-ing the diverse needs of users and their expectations of systemperformance.

  > In streaming platforms, users are provided with access tolarge repositories of audio content with only a small fraction famil-iar to them. This necessitates a new focus on one particular need:music discovery, which we define as the experience of finding andlistening to content that is previously unknown to the user.

  > We havelimited knowledge about how users behave in a discovery contextand, moreover, how these behaviors change when systems fail tosatisfy user expectations.

  > Which interactions with a recommendation system for musicdiscovery can be used to estimate user satisfaction?

  > The interviews and surveys gave insight into theuser perspective on discovery and satisfaction,[...]

  > User interviews revealed that users’ behaviors changed depending on their goals; survey data showed thatsatisfaction was correlated with achievement of goals.

  > For example, we identified four usergoals that influence behavior: play new music in the background,listen to new music now and later, find new music for later, andengage with new music. *We also learned that users expect discoveryto be hit-and-miss; just one loved track is enough for a user to feel satisfied.*

  > To  date,  little  research  exists  about  how  people  value  and form  attachments  to  virtual  possessions.

   > We  characterize  virtual  possessions  to  include the  many  objects  that  are  losing  their  lasting  material  form, such  as  books,  music,  photos,  plane  tickets,  and  money.

  > Second,  it  details  three opportunity  areas  around  value  construction  with  immaterial things:   value   in   accrual   of   social   metadata;   value   in placelessness   and   presence;   and   value   in   curation   and presentation  of  self  to  multiple  audiences;  along  with  these design  opportunities,  we  note  several  key  concerns  to  help critically frame future work in this emerging area.

  > There  is  also  emerging  HCI  research  describing  how  people  develop sentimental attachments to digital artifacts.

  > People   actively   reinvent   themselves   by   selecting   which elements of their past to keep and which to let go [21, p. 9]. While  virtual  possessions  can  play  a  potentially  important  role  in  supporting  identity  construction  processes,  how  one might dispossess a  virtual  thing  is  unclear.

   >  Ultimately, we hope this study inspires future research into  how  technologies  could  be  designed  to  engage  people with  their  virtual  possessions  in  more  valuable  and  values-oriented ways.

  > Physical  mementos  are  highly  valued,  heterogeneous  and  support  different  types  of  recollection. Contrary to expectations, we found physical mementos are not purely representational, and can involve appropriating  common  objects  and  more  idiosyncratic  forms.  In  contrast,  digital  mementos  were initially  perceived  as  less  valuable,  although  participants  later  reconsidered  this.

  >  Evaluations show  we  need  to  better understand  the  environment where  people  live,  and  the  meaning  they  attach  to  it,  rather  than  simply realising new technological possibilities (Taylor et al. 2007).

  >  One common observation  from  this  research  is  that  people  are  generally  dissatisfied  with  the  organisation  of  their collections, feeling their personal information is disorganised and hard to access. 

  > We were interested  in exploring the whole landscape of digital memories, so we asked about emails and music as well as more traditional memory objects like photos and videos. We askedwhere digital mementos were kept (PC, laptop, external hard drive, CDs, mobile  phone,  etc.), how  and when  they  were  accessed  and  used.

  > Both results seem to support Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton’s (1981) finding of ‘an enormous flexibility with which people can attach meanings to objects... Almost anything can be made to represent a set of meanings’ [p87].

  > As they began to discuss values and functions in relation to their digital collections,  participants went from being initially dismissive of their digital collections to   gradually discover they actually had digital mementos and how important those mementos were

  > Although  they were  not  recognized  as  such  initially, on  reflection people  came  to  see their  digital mementos as valuable and worth preserving. However digital belongings are perceived as problematic: being  unstable  and ephemeral  compared  with  physical  ones,  and  too  impersonal  to  fully express  the richness of memories

  > In  the  home,  different physical mementos  are  located  in  different  places,  affording  different  types  of invocation.  

  > Another intriguing possibility is the prospect of making digital mementos more mobile, i.e. taking them outside  the  home.  People  now routinely use  mp3s  and iP od  to carry  their  personal  music  with  them wherever  they  are,  allowing  them  to immerse themselves  in  their  own  sound  world  when  they  travel.

  > We employ uses   and   gratifications   theory and examine four   gratifications,   namely ubiquity,  social  connectivity,  discovering  new  music,  and  enjoyment,  as  the  predictors of continuance intention. [...] The  results  demonstrate that  enjoyment,  discovering  new  music,  and  ubiquity,  are  the  main  drivers  of  the continuance  intention.  Interestingly,  social connectivityhas  no  effect  on  continuance intention.Furthermore, premium  users experience higher  levels  of  enjoyment  and ubiquitythan  the  non-payingbasic  users.

  > Roughly a quarter (22%–26%) of U.S. adults now own a voice-enabled smart speaker such as the Amazon Echo or Google Home [6, 11].

  > People typically access music via voice in a simple, transactional manner, such as requesting to play specific songs or to change the volume.

  > We  found  that  despite  access  to streaming music content, our participants were still inclined to own media files. Our findings highlight that streaming is a  poor  substitute  for  the  gratifications  found  in  collecting music  files. Despite  this,  streaming  services  are  viewed  as an  indispensable  way  to  sample  music  and  facilitate  the aggregation of one’s media collection. 

  > The    proliferation    of    music    streaming    services highlights   the music industry’s   optimistic   view   of   the streaming-access    model    as    a    replacement    for    the downloading-ownership  model [14].  The  streaming-access model is a form of music distribution that allows listeners to access  music  content  without  inherently  owning the  files [29]. Music,   in   this   case,   is   sold   as   a   service   under subscription    contract. 

  > However,  the  majority  of  the  listeners  have  also indicated that they  prefer  to  “own”  music  despite  having  access  tostreaming  services  [4,7].

  > Playlists  were  seen  as  a  way  in  which  some  sense  of “possession” could be retained when all the content is in the cloud. It was assumed that through the playlist, users could assemble,  access,  and  share  their  music –  much  like  they would for a  music collection  that  they  owned  or  possessed [5,27]. 

  >  However,  increasingly  the  physical  and digital  boundaries are blurring   with  digital  possessions being valued  as  much  as  material  possession  and  beingmanifested  into  tangible  form [11,22].

  > This  multi-stage study  supports  that  streaming  is  not  a substitute  for  downloading,  even  though it reduces  one’s intention   to   download.   The   inadequate   experience   of collecting streamed content    questions    the    value    of collecting  in  the  streaming  age.
