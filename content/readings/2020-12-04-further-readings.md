## Further reading


Giles, D. C., Pietrzykowski, S., and Clark, K. E. (2007). The psychological meaning of personal record collections and the impact of changing technological forms. Journal of Economic Psychology, 28(4), 429–443. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joep.2006.08.002

> Recent neuropsychological evidence suggests that the more unusual collecting behaviour may result
from the failure of cognitive planning and organisation (Anderson, Damasio, & Damasio,
2005). 

> One of the important psychological functions of material possessions is their differentiating power (Csikzentmihalyi & Rochberg-Halton, 1981). They serve simultaneously
as a measure of uniqueness and of conformity. In relation to music collections, it is unlikely that any two people in any society would share an identical collection of recordings
unless they habitually purchase music as a social unit, such as a cohabiting couple, for
instance, who have amalgamated their individual collections.

> Most of the iPod owners in our sample were keen collectors of CDs as well. Indeed there
were frequent comments about the distinction between the two formats: typically, digital
downloads were used to explore new music, often friends’ recommendations, but consumers still felt a need to purchase particular favourites on CD. 

> What is needed now is data that explores nascent trends among middle teenagers whose
first purchase of recorded music is an MP3, and who associate material recordings with
older generations. It is possible, after all, that developmental factors are the key to this
distinction. From a utility perspective, it is perhaps more important for young people to
have music ‘on the move’, in constant circulation with friends, than for adults in settled
domesticity.

>Practices of collecting also tell stories about tastefulness and narrate relationships with things,
in order to construct a ‘narrative of identity, history, and situation’ (Bal, 1994: 101). Collections
become collections when there is a narrative: a beginning, a middle, and at least the prospect of an
ending. ‘One object’, writes Bal (1994: 101),
must have been the first to be acquired, but then, when it was first it was not being collected – merely
purchased, given or found, and kept because it was especially gratifying. [ ...] Collecting comes to
mean collecting precisely when a series of haphazard purchases or gifts suddenly becomes a meaningful sequence.

>What Hoy describes here is the set of curatorial practices that are implicated in collecting, but
which are absent from the streaming platforms. In his efforts to build The Spreadsheet, Hoy
‘actively, selectively, and passionately acquir[ed]’ (Belk, 1995: 67) what he perceived to be the
most desirable recording of each show represented in the known history of Phish. He then stored
each recording in a file locker and displayed the set in a virtual cabinet of popular music curiosities,
a cloud-based spreadsheet that others could browse.

>The
trophy-case tape racks that lined the 1990s Phish fan’s dorm room are now gone, a statement from
a former life, and the limited-edition posters have materialized to satisfy that unmet collecting
desire. Widespread middle-class collecting emerged in response to changing economic conditions
in the 19th century. Similarly, in the 21st century, the rise of streaming audio has provoked a shift
in what Phish fans collect and how they collect it – and today, Phish wants a cut.
