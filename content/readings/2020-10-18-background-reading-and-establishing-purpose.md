I reviewed the different resources provided on Loop.
I am currently perusing over quite a few papers -- I am finding some interesting content, especially relevant to ebooks.

Books as a Social Technology; Annika Hupfeld, Tom Rodden



For instance, how can we design e-reading technologies that:

* Can reflect personal histories of use and ownership to be passed on to others?
* Make uses of and relationships to e-books visible to facilitate social relationships and personal reflection?
* Support the management of social relationships among members of a household?
* Support processes of homemaking and settling in through connecting e-books with places of use and ownership?

Metronome Music Time Capsule: rematerialisingmusic consumption and exchange



The first concerns the possi-bility that, despite dematerialisation of the medium, materi-ality still pervades music consumption practices. The secondregards the exploration of aesthetic, cultural and social mo-tivations that inform contemporary use of playlists. Both ofthese dimensions are important considerations that shouldbe addressed in future human computer interaction (HCI)work on music playing software or playlist managementsystems.



This paper has outlined existing evidence for the continuinginfluence of materiality in patterns of digital music consump-tion. It has also shown how the human practice of playlistcreation and sharing is a key part of musical and social cul-ture, but one that is not currently well-supported by digitalmusic distribution technologies

Designing for Collections: Building Histories, Sharing the Spectacle



These values and sentiments ascribed to both physical and digital objects in the home are a specific point of interest for HCI; in particular the tensions and differences in howsentimentality and meaning are ascribed to physical versus digital objects in an increasingly digital world and what this means for the design of technology in the home (Dobbins et al. 2013, Petrelli et al. 2010).



Sellen (2011) on the other hand argues that the meaningfulness of personal objects is about far more than just memory, that instead, objects may be linked to personal and family identity, honouring others and fulfilling duty.

Digital collections and digital collecting practices

Lindley, Watkins, Sellen





Often collections of content were bound to particular contexts or devices and participants had difficulties moving content around.

// bound by format, version

Becky is struggling to unite old content with new content.



Prior work indicates that keeping track of digital posses-sions across platforms can become problematic \[24, 25].



However in this paper we have demonstrated that digital collec-tions present a distinct type of digital possession. Digital collec-tions consist of sets of acquired digital objects that are selective, have distinct boundaries, are valued for their unity, and are often

actively added to by the user.



A second set of implications involves designing more flexible tools for managing digital collections, enabling users to mark their elevated statusby separating them from other possessions and to impose their own structures of meaning. Many applica-tions impose organizational schemes that can undermine individ-uals’ sense of control over their digital collections, and make it difficult for users to organize collected items across applications, devices and platforms.



This paper advances emerging work on digital possessions by defining digital collections as distinct from other types of digital accumulations such as digital archives and clutter.
