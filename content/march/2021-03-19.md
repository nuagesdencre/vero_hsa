## Global Themes

I finished reviewing and reorganising my themes after going over my codes again. While the maps look huge at first glance, I highlighted the main themes with distinct colors and kept details to help me structure the flow of the dissertation. 

(INSERT THEMES COLOUR-CODED)

I am now working on the dissertation draft (finally!) and I have listed the questions raised during my literature review to see if I can answer most, if not all of them in the process.

Fortunately, I will meet my supervisor on Monday to receive feedback on the work completed thus far and make sure I continue in the right direction.
