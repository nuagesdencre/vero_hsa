I am currently at the stage of coding and analysis the data.
I have identified general themes, but I expect to go to finish the coding before moving on to the dissertation proper. I have gone over the transcripts only twice yet.

- Submitted proposal and received approval from DCU Ethics Committee
-   Planned the qualitative research, inductive analysis approach; thematic content analysis
- Anonymous survey first submitted across LinkedIn, Whatsapp groups and Facebook Music groups

-   Selection of sample for further interviews based on survey data
-  Semi-structured interviews with 7 participants who agreed to be contacted and advised they were Millennials
-   Limitations: time window to gather responses as interviews needed planning; self-disclosed age of participants; no incentive given to respondants; conversations conducted during the interviews might not have the exact same questions; focus only on Spotify to narrow down the sample of participants to interviews for comparison basis
- Obstacles
