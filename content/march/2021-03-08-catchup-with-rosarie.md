## Quite a few questions for my supervisor this time

Literature review (any comments?)
Transcripts and coding, emerging themes ( axial coding step)
Skeleton for dissertation draft
How to approach the methodology and the survey
How to present transcripts and appendices (i.e survey questions, interview questions, codes, thematic schemas) ---> go back once the dissertation is underway

### Compare and contrast how Millennial music enthusiasts relate to physical music collections (CDs, vinyl records, etc.) and music streaming services.

*Preparing the dissertation draft*
- Telling a story based on what was found from the interviews and the survey

*Going over the themes and further refining them* 

1. Curating music collection
    - Where to find the music
    - Music selection process
    - Limitations (physical space and cost)
2. The intangible values of music
    - Cognitive value (emotional connection, listening to music as a standalone activity, music as a background noise)
    - Social value (self-presentation, sharing music, live events)
3. Convenience as the overarching priority across all aspects
    - Reliability
    - Practicality (immediacy)
