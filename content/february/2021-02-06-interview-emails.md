## Interview Emails


### First email - invitation to participate in the interview and confirmation of a few key points

> Dear Â¬name,

>As you may recall, at the end of a preliminary survey, you kindly volunteered your contact information to participate in an interview in the context of a research study. This research study aims to compare and contrast how music enthusiasts relate to physical music collections and music streaming services.
The interview will take approximately 30 minutes during which I will simply try to capture your thoughts and perspectives on accessing and curating music collections. As a music enthusiast, you are in an ideal position to give us valuable firsthand information from your own perspective.
There is no compensation for participating; however, your contribution will be a valuable addition to the research study. The findings could lead to the improvement of online collection interfaces and the delivery of more valuable user experiences when accessing music via a streaming service.
Can you respond to this email to confirm that you are still willing to participate?
If so, please confirm the following in your reply - as the survey was submitted anonymously:
>1)      Are you part of the Millennial generational cohort? (born between the years 1980 - 2000)
>2)      Do you own physical music records?
>3)      Do you use music streaming services?
>This will help me narrow down a representative sample for the research study. Be assured the responses to the questions will be kept confidential.
I will be in touch shortly following your reply. If I do not hear from you, I will assume you are no longer interested and I will not contact you further. If you have any questions in the meantime, please do not hesitate to ask.
Thank you once again,
Veronique
