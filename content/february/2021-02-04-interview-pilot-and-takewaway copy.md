Interview pilot

- flow was less evident
- be careful not to give leading questions
- keep conversation natural and advise where we are in the interview



**Updated interview questions as a result**

**Introduction**
 
Hi <name>,
How are you! Thank you for joining me today.

Lovely to meet you, I’m Veronique. As part of a research study, I am comparing how Millennials who love music interact with the physical music records and the music accessible via streaming services. Before our interview, you completed the preliminary survey and we have established that you agreed to be contacted to participate further in this research study, perfect.

Is it ok to record the interview? It’ll help me focus on what you’re saying as I can go back to review our session later instead of taking notes. I can also provide you with a copy of the transcript once available. Do you have any questions before we start? OK - I’ll start recording now.

 Today I would like to ask some questions about how you listen to music and your music collections. There is no right or wrong answer, you don’t have to address all the questions I’ll ask you. If you feel any discomfort at any point, we can pause or stop the interview and I can provide you with external support resources if you desire.

1.     Tell me a little about yourself.
2.     Why is music important in your life?
    Tell me a little about what type of music you like best.

    Is there a particular moment when you rely on music to help you? (I.e. concentrate, relax, focus, process difficult thoughts, dance)
    What is a memory you have that is either linked to music or that music brings back to you? (For instance, a lullaby that your parents use to sing).
    Do you remember the last time you actively listened to music? Tell me about that.
    Do you remember the last time that you get lost in the music?
    Is listening to music a personal or a shared experience for you?
    Do you like attending live events (concerts, operas, theater)? What has been your favourite experience?
3.     How do you like to organize your music?

    b) Only physical

    c) Only streaming services

    How do you find and select new music?
    How do move around and arrange the music you already have on playlists or as part of your physical collection?

How do you keep track of what other people are listening to?

(a, b) Do you have special editions or celebratory editions / re-release  of certain albums?

Do you have music that you stream online for which you don’t have a physical copy? Is there a particular reason?

The opposite – is there music that you listen to only using your physical copy?

4.     Do you listen to your physical music more often than you use the streaming service? Has that changed over the past years?

Have you kept any physical music records and why? Do you think the quality of music has improved over time with technology?

What about the quality of digital music from a streaming services?
Do you purchase digital music at all? By song , albums…

If you had all the money and the space in the world, how would you listen to your music?

 As a final thought, do you think streaming services can replace traditional collections entirely?
 
**Conclusion**

Do you have any questions? Is there anything you would like to add that did not come up in the session?
Thank you for your time and effort. This information will be kept private and reviewed in the context of our research study. If you want, we can send you a copy of the research once it is published as well.
