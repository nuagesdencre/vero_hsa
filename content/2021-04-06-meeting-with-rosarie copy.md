## Meeting with Rosarie

- I updated the thematic maps I was working on. I used LucidChart to ensure the content is legible and easy to understand.
There are two thematic maps, one for each global theme identified.

- I completed a fully fleshed draft of the dissertation but I feel a bit overwhelmed. I am reviewing different online resources to find tips and tricks how to tackle the task; it turns out there are a few ways of writing dissertations. 

-  I have access to PowerBI and I am exploring ways of visualising the data extracted from the survey. This data was helpful in selecting the participants for the interviews.

- I have revisited the literature review and the introduction.


*TO DO:*
- Preparing the actual document (appendices, cleaning up extracts from the interviewsâ€¦)
- Drawing parallels from the survey
