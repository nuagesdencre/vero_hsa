**Good evening**,

I have decided to track my progress online for the duration of the HSA module.

This is a first post and a test.

I am currently looking into a question. More specifically, the research question.

**What is a research question?**\
A research question is the question around which you center your research. It should be:

* **clear**: it provides enough specifics that one’s audience can easily understand its purpose without needing additional explanation.
* **focused**: it is narrow enough that it can be answered thoroughly in the space the writing task allows.
* **concise**: it is expressed in the fewest possible words.
* **complex**: it is not answerable with a simple “yes” or “no,” but rather requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to composition of an answer.
* **arguable**: its potential answers are open to debate rather than accepted facts.

You should ask a question about an issue that you are genuinely curious and/or passionate about.
