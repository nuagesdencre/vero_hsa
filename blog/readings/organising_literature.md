## Making it easier to refer to the articles

While I have been keeping track of my readings, at the time of writing the literature review I need to revisit and digest it anew.

I have decided to structure the articles I have saved in separate folders as I go through them again.

I am also combing through the articles and grouping them using tables in attempt to retrieve the observations more easily.
