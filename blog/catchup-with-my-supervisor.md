# First meeting

Note for future calls
- record conversation to take note of all ideas

## _Discussion_

/ + / Interesting idea; wide reach as people feel strongly about music

/ - / Too many elements and questions were raised in the proposal; I need to narrow the focus and clarify outcome desired

## Revisiting the ideas presented in my proposal

- Notes and observations
    - I needed to narrow down the focus of my research.
    Going through the proposal, I came to the conclusion that amidst the many angles approached, the _curation_ one is to be explored.

    Reformulating the research question as *'how can streaming services fulfill the emotional connection that Millenials experience with curated physical music collections?'*

    - Firstly, I need to find out the key elements that establish an emotional connection. I have to clearly establish what constitutes a _collection_ versus an accumulation of music. I also need to relate how playlists compare to albums. Lastly, I have to explain clearly what  curation entails.

    - I also need to gather data to compare and contrast how people interact with their physical music collection versus streaming music using online services.

    - Secondary questions to *support* the main point:
        - Are there differences in physical music purchase and music in streamed playlist? (i.e would someone have personal music taste they don't feel comfortable to stream but would buy for private listening)
        - Is modern living in terms of technology and space constraints motivating the music interaction habits? (i.e. no room in a small appartment for a big vinyl collection; no easy to carry CD music player available anymore, etc.)
        - Does physical context play a part in how people interact with their music?
        - How comfortable are the subjects with the technology changes over time (i.e. using new systems and devices to access their music)?

### These questions will be broken down and inserted into the questionnaire. 
___

Based on the above, to make sure the data gathered is valid, I want to target a poll of subjects that:

   - fall in the _millenial_ group (born in the years 1980â€“2000). Subjects that are not millenials but are not part of a vulnerable group (ages over 18 and under 65) are also acceptable.
  - are passionate about music
  - own physical music records (CDs, vinyls, etc.) and use online streaming services
  - listen to music regularly
___

## Research methods and approach - updated

- 1 / questionnaire
  - to first reach out and identify the relevant pool of subjects; data gathered expeected to be mostly quantitative; extend invitation to participate further in the research study
- 2 / diary studies (dscout.com)
  - connect with a small sample of people to gather data over the course of 1 to 2 weeks relevant to their interaction with music; both qualitative and quantitative data

**Depending on the data accumulated so far**
- 3 / focus group
- 4 / semi-structured interviews
  - to consolidate data gathered thus far and further explore the emotional connection experience from an individual and a social (group) point of view

> This approach to data collection methods is structured as:
>- It might be more realistic to focus on 2 research methods, however based on findings and resources, an additional research method might be beneficial
>- Because individual and group perspectives are important for the  research, a focus group might offer additional insight especially in terms of context and buying/streaming behaviours

Moreover, I have to define how I measure the emotional connection or satisfaction during the interaction of a subject with his/her music. 
  - suggestion: likert scale
  - explore what has been done in previous related research
