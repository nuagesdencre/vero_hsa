Please have a look and let me know what you think!
I reviewed your comments and also listened to the feedback of the few people who looked at the original questions.

I also am preparing the social media blurbs as appropriate.

As part of my Higher Diploma in Interaction Design (DCU), I am conducting a research study to compare and contrast how music enthusiasts relate to physical music collections (CDs, vinyl records, etc.) and music streaming services. 
I am looking to get 300 participants, aged 18 or older, to fill a 7-10 minute survey. The survey will be submitted anonymously. At the end of that survey, participants will be given an option to share their details to be contacted for a follow up interview at a later time. 
All data collected over the course of this study will be anonymized; the study has received full ethical approval from DCU. The aim of the research study is to identify if Millennials in particular consider music streaming services (such as Spotify) equivalent to physical music collections. Any discrepancies identified will be useful in improving online collection interfaces and delivering more valuable user experiences when accessing music via a streaming service.
I kindly request your help with this endeavour; participating and sharing this survey with your connections would go a long way. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.The link to the survey is attached below, thank you in advance for your time and contribution!

If music is an important part of your life and you access it via all means possible, it would be great if you could answer the survey below.
