title: Reviewing my plan draft
---

## Revisiting the research question 
Original Question:
Do Millenials experience a similar emotional connection between their curated physical music collections and music curated using streaming services?
 - How to measure an emotional connection?
    - By Emotional connection → attachment

/ - / to be refined in something that can be more explicitly measured; improve wording

Updated Question:
**Do Millenials have the same relationship with their curated physical music collections as they do with music curated using streaming services?**

## Revisiting the goal

Old goal submission:
Based on existing literature, collectors feel very strongly about their physical possessions even at a time where artefacts tend to become digital. I want to compare the emotional relationship of music consumers with their physical music collection and online streaming playlists to establish if going forward, technology can bridge that emotional connection gap.

/ - / needs more elaboration

- Observation during discussion with supervisor: *Compare relationship instead of emotional relational*

New goal submission:
Based on existing literature, collectors feel very strongly about their physical possessions even at a time where artefacts tend to become digital.
I want to see how Millenial music lovers relate to the music they stream in comparison to how they relate to their music collected in physical storage (CDs, vinyls, etc.). I want to collect data to compare usage (frequency and context), longevity (listening patterns or preference over time, discovery and sharing habits), curation (organisational structure/playlists and personal signification).  
I want to glean the Millenials overall satisfaction with both ways of accessing music and gain insight to establish if going forward, technology can bridge any relationship gap.

## TL;DR 
### What do we measure and how
- Usage
- Longevity
- Curation
- Satisfaction

→ use clear barometers of comparison


## Looking at parallel research

I brough up the following article to remove any doubt that the research I propose still is original and distinctive even if similar or parallel observations have been made by others.

Article:
Ng, J., & Yew, J. (2017). Why download when you can stream? The experience of collecting music in the streaming age. ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, Part F129310, 28–33. https://doi.org/10.1145/3077343.3077346
