title: Planning the research in more details
---

### **Project Name**

 Compare and contrast the emotional connection that music consumers experience with physical music collections and music streaming services


### **Research Question**

Why do Millenials experience a greater emotional connection with their curated physical music collections compared to streaming services and playlists?


### Research Aim: 


Based on existing literature, collectors feel very strongly about their physical possessions even at a time where artifacts tend to become digital. I want to compare and contrast the emotional relationship of music consumers with their physical music collection and online streaming playlists to establish if going forward, technology can bridge that emotional connection gap.


### Project plan

Proposed research schedule

Pilot Study - Start January 2021
Data collection - January 2021
Data coding February 2021
Data analysis March 2021

### Design and methodology

`Description of data collection methods and instruments; explanation of how reliability and validity will be assessed/how the quality of the project will be assessed; what method of data analysis is to be utilised.`

Using methodological triangulation to draw data from different sources at different times using a variety of data gathering techniques. While it might not be possible to achieve true triangulation, this approach might permit different insights from the data analysis that ensues.

A pilot study will be conducted with a limited number of participants (likely peers) as a trial to ensure the methods are viable. The pilot study participants will not be involved in the main study of course.

#### *Data collection methods*

- Questionnaire
 
  A questionnaire will be presented to any participants answering the call to action. The questionnaire will take approximatively 5 to 7 minutes to complete.

- Semi-structured interviews and Focus groups

  I will build on the existing data gathered during the survey by conducting semi-structured interviews and a focus group in turn.

  - Interviews
    
    I will have a basic script and cover the same key elements with all interviewees. I will rely on probes and prompts to get more elaborated information.
    The interviews will be recorded (audio and video). The interviewees will not be anonymous. The data issued from the study will however be anonymised.
    The limitation of this method: online conversation; limited view of body language

  - Focus group
  
    Depending on the data gathered so far, it might be relevant to have more than one focus group -- especially if I want to separate representative sample of the population. The session(s) will be recorded (audio and video) for a follow-up analysis and transcription. In order to keep the conversation between participants flowing, I will abstain from taking notes and simply guide the participants in their discussion.
    Because the focus group session(s) will be recorded and the participants will not be anonymous. The data issued from the study will however be anonymised.
    The limitation of this method: online conversation; limited view of body language; participants might have submissive or dominant personalities disrupting the conversation

**if required for further data collection**
 - Diary Studies

    As a possible mean of supporting the data gathered thus far, I will invite a limited amount of participants to track their interaction with music via a diary study.

    - Extraction of the past month's data from Spotify
    - WhatsApp or text message check in when using physical music

### Details on participants
 `How they are recruited; what, if any, incentives will be given; where participants will be interviewed or tested; duration of the testing/interview period.`

Study population - trickle down participants

  For the questionnaire: sample target of 100-400 people 
  For the semi-structured interviews: 5 to 8 people
  For the focus group: 4 or 5 people

  If relevant;
  For the diary studies: sample target of 10 to 12 people

 The participants are adult and fall into the group of Millenials (born between 1980 and 2000). As they are over the ages of 18 years and under 65 years old, they are not considered vulnerable in terms of their group. The participants are music lovers who own music in a physical format (Cds, vinyls, etc.) and use music streaming services as well.


### Assessment of risk
 `Will deception be involved; is there potential for physical, psychological or social risk, and if so why? Will the procedure require participants to reveal details of a sensitive nature; for what purpose? What are the procedures for minimising distress? Will substances be administered? Are there any other risks, including to the researcher? What safeguards are in place if there are any adverse or unexpected outcomes?`

### Assessment of benefits: 
`What are the likely benefits to the participants?`

### Protection of anonymity: 
`What arrangements you will make to protect anonymity and maintain confidentiality?`

### Respect for participants: Is participation voluntary? Can participants withdraw from the study?
- Establishing a clear and professional relationship with the participants.
- Plain language disclosure

### Informed consent: What briefing procedures will be used? Copies of proposed briefing sheets, protocols and informed consent forms must be included.
  - Informed consent

### Reporting on results: 
`Details on your debriefing procedure; details on where and how results will be disseminated and whether participants will receive information on the research findings.`

### Arrangements for storage and disposal of data: 
`Who will have access to the data, where will it be stored and how will it be disposed of?`


### Provide clear definitions

- collections
- possession and ownership
- streaming service
