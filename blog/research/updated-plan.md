### **Project Name**

 Compare and contrast the relationship that music consumers have with physical music collections and music streaming services


### **Research Question**

Do Millenials have the same relationship with their curated physical music collections as they do with music curated using streaming services?


### Research Aim: 

Based on existing literature, collectors feel very strongly about their physical possessions even at a time where artefacts tend to become digital.
I want to see how Millenial music lovers relate to the music they stream in comparison to how they relate to their music collected in physical storage (CDs, vinyls, etc.). I want to collect data to compare usage (frequency and context), longevity (listening patterns or preference over time, discovery and sharing habits), curation (organisational structure/playlists and personal signification).  
I want to glean the Millenials overall satisfaction with both ways of accessing music and gain insight to establish if going forward, technology can bridge any relationship gap.


### Project plan

Proposed research schedule

Pilot Study - Start January 2021
Data collection - January 2021
Data coding February 2021
Data analysis March 2021

### Design and methodology

Using methodological triangulation to draw data from different sources at different times using a variety of data gathering techniques. While it might not be possible to achieve true triangulation, this approach might permit different insights from the data analysis that ensues.

A pilot study will be conducted with a limited number of participants (likely peers) as a trial to ensure the methods are viable. The pilot study participants will not be involved in the main study of course.

#### *Data collection methods*

- Survey
 
  A ~~questionnaire~~ survey will be presented to any participants answering the call to action. The ~~questionnaire~~ survey will take approximatively 5 to 7 minutes to complete.

- Semi-structured interviews 

  I will build on the existing data gathered during the ~~questionnaire~~ survey by conducting semi-structured interviews.

  - Interviews
    
    I will have a basic script and cover the same key elements with all interviewees. I will rely on probes and prompts to get more elaborated information.

    The interviews will be recorded (audio and video). The interviewees will not be anonymous at the time of recording. The data issued from the study will however be anonymised.
  
    The limitation of this method: online conversation; limited view of body language

 - Spotify Data Analysis

    - Extraction of the past year's data from Spotify
    - Analysis of listening patterns based on streaming history


### Details on participants

#### *Study population*

  - For the ~~questionnaire~~ survey: sample target of 100-400 people 
  - For the semi-structured interviews: 5 to 8 people

  I aim for a confidence rating of 80%.

 The participants fall into the group of Millenials (born between 1980 and 2000). As they are over the ages of 18 years and under 65 years old, they are not considered vulnerable in terms of their group. The participants are music lovers who own music in a physical format (Cds, vinyls, etc.) and use music streaming services as well.


### Assessment of risk
 Limitations: 
 More than one streaming service exists.

 There will be no deception in the context of this research study.

### Assessment of benefits: 
 To do something interesting.

### Protection of anonymity: 
`What arrangements you will make to protect anonymity and maintain confidentiality?`

### Respect for participants: Is participation voluntary? Can participants withdraw from the study?
- Establishing a clear and professional relationship with the participants.
- Plain language disclosure

### Informed consent: What briefing procedures will be used? Copies of proposed briefing sheets, protocols and informed consent forms must be included.
  - Informed consent

### Reporting on results: 

Participants can opt to be informed when the research study is published and they will be given contact details to reach out the researcher.

### Arrangements for storage and disposal of data: 

The named researchers are the only ones to have access to the data.

The data and recordings will be stored exclusively in security-encrypted computers. USB keys will not be used. When files are being shared, it will be through DCU Gmail in password protected files, with a phone call made to supply to password separately. Computers are secured by encryption. The named researchers have exclusive access to those computers.

The documents and recordings containing participants’ information details will be destroyed after one years. Electronic data will be erased by the investigators. Only the anonymized data set will be kept for future study.
